<h1>Apollo's Home</h1>
<p>This place was inspired by the Northern Lights and i picked this because I wanted to ick a place that seems all nice and beautiful to contrast the sadness that Apollo feels. The northern lights are among some of the most beautiful things in life, so the idea came naturally,the idea of making somethin beautiful hide something sad. I wanted a galaxy as his home, but this town under the Northern Lights made more sense in terms of story telling. You are captivated by the colors and dont pay attention to the stuff in the background and thats how apollo feels. A person surrounded by such beautifu things, but no one cares for him.</p>
